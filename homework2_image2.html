    <h1>Homework 2 Image 2</h1>
    <p>Here is the second image for Homework 2:</p>
    <img src="homework_2_image_2.jpg" alt="Homework 2 Image 2" width="600">

    <p>I had a similar goal when taking this image with the previous image of wanting to have movement captured within the photograph, but I decided to do it a little differently through taking a more bird's eye view image of the same location rather than being up close to the photo taking location. 
      Considering it was the same location and same time period of day, I ran into the similar issue of an overwhelming brightness from the top right concern of the image due to the sunlight. Thus, I decided to try and tone down the sunlight's brightness through increasing the contrast of the image to 
      make the buildings on the right end of the image be more likely to be seen through the sunlight, and drawing in a bit more attention to the subjects overed in the shade casued by the Hunter sky bridge on the opposite concern of the image. Then I slightly lowered down the photograph's brightness in photoshop, to 
      make the building subjects covered in the sunlight more visible as well as the little details each building has be less covered in sunlight. I added a little bit of saturation manipulation to enchance some of the ssubjects covered in shape to be more bolder when seen. Finally, I cropped the image to have the 
      road be reflective of the two-thirds rule, with the road covering two-thirds of the image from the right side through cropping down the image from the right side to achieve this effect.</p>
