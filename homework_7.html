    <h1>Homework #7: Illustrated Environments</h1>
    <p>Create a illustrated version of an environment, an image from a photograph of whatever environment chosen, using all the tools on Adobe Illusrator and limited color choice of 3 colors. Following 
    explain why the initial environment was chosen and how it was transformed in the illustrated image.</p>

    <h2>Original Environment</h2>

    <h2>Illustrated version</h2>
    <img src="" alt="Illustrated version" width="600">
    <p>I choose my environment image in order to have a more dynamic environment within the image to make an illustrated version of. Additionally, I just didn't want to make it seem like I was tracing off of 
    an image if it was too simiplistic, so I went to having an environment with more details within it. This is also to relate with the limited color choice, </p>
