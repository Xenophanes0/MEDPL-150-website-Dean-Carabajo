    <h1>Homework #7: Illustrated Environments</h1>
    <p>Create a illustrated version of an environment, an image from a photograph of whatever environment chosen, using all the tools on Adobe Illusrator and limited color choice of 3 colors. Following 
    explain why the initial environment was chosen and how it was transformed in the illustrated image.</p>

    <h2>Original Environment</h2>

    <h2>Illustrated version</h2>

    <p>I chose my environment image of the Manhattan Bridge in order to have a more dynamic-like and detailed environment within the image to make an illustrated version of, as I didn't want to pick a simplistic image. I initially thought that it would be easy to 
    "transform" an image using illustrator tools. It is much more time-consuming and hurts the hands more if you are using only the mouse and keyboard to perform all transformations in the photo. Finally, the limitation of only using 3 colors in the illustrated version 
    of the environment did limit my usage of creating different structures in my image. Considering the industrialized environment of my environment, I decided to use a triad color scheme of darker colors to use for my illustration (#DB704A, #86665A, #4D4F5C), as those 
    colors would fit the environment of my image the most. I transformed the image through creating several structures, such as the road, gate-fixures and the bridge pillars, simulating many different structures in the image across several different layers. This is so I 
    could move some structures over one another through changing the layer order of the file. The majority of the structures were created with the pen tool. I added some gradient features on some of the structures, like the road, to make the image less 2D looking and I 
    changed the opacity of some structures that are more in the background, in order to add an effect of depth of field. Finally, I used the draw tool in order to stimulate the chain-link fabric on the gates in the image. I also added in a background layer with one of the 
    selected colors to add in the sky as in the original environment, rather than just leaving it white and because my chosen image doesn't cover my entire artboard, so it would have left white space to the sides of the illustration made, so I added in the background to try 
    and cover up this fact. I didn't want to sketch my image past the artboard limiations and potiential cutting out details from the image to the illustrated environment when making it. I also added in a gradient to that background layer as well to help differentiate it from 
    other drawings in the illustration that uses the same color as the background layer.</p>
