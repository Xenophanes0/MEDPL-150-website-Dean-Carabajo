    <h1>Homework #7: Illustrated Environments</h1>
    <p>Create a illustrated version of an environment, an image from a photograph of whatever environment chosen, using all the tools on Adobe Illusrator and limited color choice of 3 colors. Following 
    explain why the initial environment was chosen and how it was transformed in the illustrated image.</p>

    <h2>Original Environment</h2>

    <h2>Illustrated version</h2>

    <p>I choose my environment image of the Manhattan Bridgein order to have a more dynamic-like and detailed environment within the image to make an illustrated version of, as I didn'twant to pick a simplistic image. I initially thought that it would be easy to 
    "transform" an image image using illustrator tools. It is much more time-consuming and hurts the hands more if do are doing only mouse and keyboard to perofrm transformations. Finally, the limation of only using 3 colors in the illsutrated version of the environment 
    did limit my usage of creating different structures in my image. Considering the industrailized environment of my environment, I decided to use a traid color scheme of darker colors to use for my illustraziation (#DB704A, #86665A, #4D4F5C), as those colors would 
    fit the environment of my image the most. I transfomred the image through creating several structures, such as the road, gate-fixures and the bridge pillars, similuating many different structures in the image across several different layers. This is so I could move 
    some structures over one another through changing the layer order of the file. Majority of the structures were created with the pen tool. I added some gradient features on some of the structures, like the road, to make the image less 2D looking and I changed the opacity 
    of some structures that are more in the backgriound, in order to add an effect of depth of field. Finally, I used the draw tool in order to stimulate the chain-link fabric on the gates in the image.
