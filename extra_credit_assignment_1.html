    <p>I really like how this art project tries to encapsulate the feeling of being a person that was trapped in the locations, and time, where one of the differing natural disasters included in the artwork had occurred. This was achieved through the use of stimulating each disaster as a 3D box with each box being reflections of each natural disasters 
      they are representing, for example the box representing the 2025 California wildfires has a wavering texture to it with only the warm colors of the color wheel being on and within the box, like the box itself was set on fire. This is in contrast to the box representing the 2021 Zhengzhou flood, being a water-like texture and ripping effect on the 
      outside of the box, like something being dropped into a body of water and the small waves that form from the impact that push out to the rest of the body of water. Additionally, the inside of the boxes have audio and visuals that would be representative of ach disaster. with the Zhengzhou box entirely raining on the inside of it, with the audio of 
      heavy rain playing within the box. The only other thing inside the box being the bottom appearing like the surface of the sea. This being contrasted to the previously mentioned wildfires box, with the only object being a building in ruin, covered in flames, with a few fire animations surrounding it. The audio reflects this being only a raging fire 
      that loops while inside the box. Sort of enjoy that some disasters that were man-made are also in the artpiece, such as one box being a representation of the Great Smog of 1952 in London, where a heavy smog, visible haze of air pollution, covered over the entire city of London for several days, being so thick that some citizens reported they were 
      unable to see past 3 feet in front of them. Many died because of the pollution, with the event caused by the industrialization of the location, alongside little care towards air quality control, resulting in decades of smoke to build up for years, until that stretch of 5 days in December for those unlucky enough to experience this.

        This artwork hits home deeply because for all human achievements since that ancient past of the human race on Earth, we have continued to evolve and find ways to survive and thrive into prosperous civilizations throughout human history. From the initial founding of fire before written history to now living on a majority of the planet in vast countries, 
      with some having weapons of mass destruction that could destroy the very planet humans built. Additionally being able to create vaccines for diseases and viruses, including some of the most deadly, like the bubonic plague (Black Death), or completely eradicated like Smallpox back in 1980. Through all of these accomplishments it would seem that the 
      human race is unstoppable, being able to overcome any adversity that may come across, except for disasters from the natural world. Raging wildfires, earthquakes, intense flooding and erupting volcanoes are some examples of natural disasters, which can cause vast amounts of destruction in their wake in the matter of mere moments. The only things that 
      were done to react to natural disasters, were warning systems and equipment to track if a natural disaster was going to occur and how deadly they might be, but never to completely prevent the upcoming tragedy. Most of these are too quick and destructive to completely prevent across the world, the best that can be done is having better measures to track 
      these occurrences and warning those in the affected area as much as possible. Take the July Texas flood earlier this year, with one timelapse video concerning the event showcased a small river connected to a road that was completely flooded by raging water in under 3 minutes and still rising. Even more terrifying is that in the same timelapse, any trees 
      in the way of the flood are also being uprooted and carried away in the flood as well. This showcasing just how destructive and cruel the environment we live in can become in the matter of moments and how much of our grapple on the planet can be undone, several times faster than us building a place to live there.</p>
