    <h1>New Art City (Online) - Ruins of Tomorrow - 10/28/2025</h1>
    <h2>By: Sophia zichen Lyu</h2>
    <p>I really like how this art project tries to encapsulate the feeling of being a person that was trapped in the locations, and time, where one of the differring natural disasters included in the artwork had occured. This was achieved through the use of stimulating each disaster as a 3D box with each box being a reflection fo each 
      natural disaster, for example the box representating the 2025 California wildfires has a wavering texture to it with only the warm colors of the color wheel being on and within the box, like the box itself was set on fire. This is in contrast to thye box representaing the 2021 Zhengzhou flood, being a water-like texture and ripping 
      effect on the outside of the box, like something being dropped into a body of water and the small waves that form from the impact that push out to the rest of the body of water. Additionally, the inside of the boxes having audio and visuals that would be representative of ach disaster. with the Zhengzhou box entirely raining on the inside 
      of it, with the audio of heavy rain playing within the box. The only other thing inside the box being the bottom appearing like the surface of the sea. This being contrasted to the prevousily mentioned wildfires box, with the only object being a building in ruin, covered in flames, with a few fire animations surrounding it. The audio reflecting 
      this being only a raging fire that loops while inside the box. Sort of enjoy that some disasters that were maan-made are also in the artpiece, such as one box being a representation of the Great Smog of 1952 in Logdon, where a heavy smog, visible haze of air pollution, covered over the entire city of London for several days, being so thick that 
      some citizens reported they were inable to see past 3 feet in front of them. Many died because of the pollution, with the event caused by the industralization of the location, alongside little care towards air quality control, resulting in decades of smoke to build up for years, until that stretch of 5 days in December for those unluck enough 
      to experience this.

        This artwork hits home deeply because for all human achievements since that ancient past of the human race on Earth, we have continue to evolve and find ways to survive and thrive into posperous civilizations throughout human history. From the intial founding of fire before written history to now living on a majority of the planet in vast 
      countries, with some having weapons of mass destruction that could destroy the very planet humans built. Additionally being able to create vaccines for diseases and viruses, including some of the most deadliest like the bubonic plague (Black Death), or completely eradicated smallpox back in 1980. Through all of these accomplishments it would 
      seem that the human race is unstoppable, being able to overcome any adversity that may come across, except for disasters from the natural world. Raging wildfires, earthquakes, intense flooding and erupting volcanoes are some exemples of natural disasters, which can cuase vast amounts of destruction in their wake in the matter of mere moments. 
      The only things that were done to reaction to natural disasters, were warning systems and equipment to track if a natural disaster was going to occur and how deadly they might be, but never to complete prevetn the upcoming tradegy. Most of these are too quick and desctrive to complete prevent across the world, the best that can be done is having 
      better measures to track these occurrances and warning those in the affected area as some as possible. Take the July Texas flood earlier this year, with one timelapse video concerning the event showcased a small river connected to a road that was completely flood by ragining water in under 3 minutes and still rising. Every more terrorifying that 
      in the same timelapse, any trees in the way of the flood are also being uprooted and carried away in the flood as well. This showcasing just how destructive and cruel the environemnt we live in can become in the matter of moments and how much of our grapple on the planet can be undone, several times faster than us building a place to live there.</p>
