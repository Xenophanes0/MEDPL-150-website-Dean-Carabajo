    <h1>Homework 4  - Social Campaign: Photomontages</h1>
    <h2>2 Photomontages that reflect a political, social or ecological issue:</h2>

    <h3>Photomontage #1 - Pollution</h3>

    <p>For this photomontage, I wanted to base it off of the environmental issue of pollution contaminating the environment, especially noticeable in first world countries like New York City within the United States. I wanted this photomontage image to be a reflection that while environmental protection is usually a major issue that many climate 
    activists believe that should garner most of the public's attention, the general populous just doesn't care. This is especially true considering there is a giant "garbage island" off in the Pacific Ocean, that being the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This island is a physical representation of how little people care about the issue of pollution 
    and how many people littering/ throwing out their trash into the surrounding environment, so much so that a literal island comprised of plastic waste floating in the ocean, off the coast of California. Worse yet, is the example I'm pointing too is one of five total garbage patches floating in the ocean, while there are effects to cleanup 
    these garbage patches, how indifferent does the general populace have to be that vast amounts of thrown out waste accumulates into the ocean to such an amount that an "island" is formed. I wanted to reflect this in this photomontage through having people going about their day, apathetic to a vast amount of garbage in the ocean behind them. To 
    add onto this by including one of the most famous locations on the planet in the background, letting filth accumulate to such a degree. Mainly trying to do a similar recognition of how people view the Gilded Age of American history, being nothing more than a fleeting image of something prosperous.

      The images I used for this photomontage are a mix between images from google search, Unsplash, Pexels and Openverse. Used the mask tool to try and create people walking, minding their own business, in front of a gate with an ocean in the background. Additionally adding in the skyline for NYC to add an aura of prestige to the image, then adding
    in different images of trash in the water. Finally, using the gradient tool on the trash image group alongside the skyline image to create a sense of depth of field, that as further away the trash got within the water, the harder it was to see, so that it doesn't just look like a bunch of images cropped onto one another. For blend mode, I applied 
    the blend mode of multiply in order to try and darken the image, mainly for the skyline of NYC in the background. A bit of a way to illustrate a form of falsehood, that even though the big apple of New York is supposed to represent a beautiful, marvelous location and physical representation of the United States values of freedom and library 
    for all, with the Statue of Library being one of the first things one sees when entering NYC through sea methods, there is still dirt and grime throughout the city. One of the most explicit would be taking the MTA system, with there being constant trash on the subway rails, inconsistent trains for what is supposed to be the main way that 
    New Yorkers travel within the city without a car or bus, and constant pests that live on subway stations/ tunnels. I have to take the J and E trains in order to reach Manhattan  from farther eastern Queens and I know about the careless attitude the staff and other New Yorkers feel towards general maintenance and appearance of the subway stations.</p>
