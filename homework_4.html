    <h1>Homework 4  - Social Campaign: Photomontages</h1>
    <p>2 Photomontages that reflect a political, social or ecological issue:</p>

    <h2>Photomontage #1 - Pollution</h2>

    <p>For this photomontage, I wanted to based it off of the environmetal issue of pollution contaminating the environment, espically noticable in first world countries like the New York City within the United States. I wanted this photomontage image to be a reflection hat while environmental protection is usually a major issue that many climate 
      activists believe that should garner most of the public's attention, the general popolous just doesn't care. This is espcially true considering there is a ginat "garbade island" off in the Pacific Ocean, that being the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This island is a

      The images I used for this photomontage are a mix between images from google search, Unsplash, Pexels and Openverse. Used the mask tool to try and create people waling, minding their own business, in front of a gate with an oceaan in the background. Additonally adding in the skyline for NYC to add a aura of prestige to the image, then adding
    in different images of trash in the water. Finally using the gradient tool on the trash image group alongside the skyline image to create a sense of depth of field, that as further away the trash got within the water, the harder it was to see, so that it doesn't just look like a bunch of images cropped onto one another. For blend mode, I applied 
    the blend mode of multiply in order to try and darken the image, mainly for the skyline of NYC in the background. A bit of a way to illutstratte a form of falsehood, that even though the big apple of New York is suppose to represent a beatifulful, marvalous location and physical representation of Uthe United States values of freedom and library 
    for all, with the Statue of Library being one of the first things one sees when entering into the NYC through sea methods, there is still dirt and grime throughout the city. One of the most explicit would be taking the MTA system, with there being constant trash on the subway rails, inconsistent trains for what is supposed to be the main way that 
    New Yorkers travel within the city without a car or bus, and constant pests that live on subway stations/ tunnels. I have to take the J and E trains in order to reach Manhattan  from farther eastern Queesn and I know about the carelesss attitude the staff and other New Yorkers feel towards general maintance and appearance of the subway stations. 
    On a couple of occasions when walking down to the J train portion of the Sutphin Blvd-Archer AV-JFK Airport station, you can see clear as day, a giant rat on the station platform at one end of the station before it then runs away into the subway tunnel at the approach of people filling up the platform. So I just felt that darken the image felt like 
    the right move in terms display this point across.</p>
