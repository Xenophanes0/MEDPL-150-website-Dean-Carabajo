    <h1>Homework 4  - Social Campaign: Photomontages</h1>
    <p>2 Photomontages that reflect a political, social or ecological issue:</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Photomontage #1 - Pollution</h2>

    <p>For this photomontage, I wanted to based it off of the environmetal issue of pollution contaminating the environment, espically noticable in first world countries like the New York City within the United States. 
      For blend mode, I applied the blend mode of multiply in order to try and darken the image, mainly for the skyline of NYC in the background. A bit of a way to illutstratte a form of falsehood, that even though the big apple of New York is suppose to represent a beatifulful, marvalous location and physical representation of Uthe United States 
    values of freedom and library for all, with the Statue of Library being one of the first things one sees when entering into the NYC through sea methods, there is still dirt and grime throughout the city. One of the most explicit would be taking the MTA system, with there being constant trash on the subway rails, inconsistent trains for what is 
    supposed to be the main way that New Yorkers travel within the city without a car or bus, and constant pests that live on subway stations/ tunnels. I have to take the J and E trains in order to reach Manhattan  from farther eastern Queesn and I know about the carelesss attitude the staff and other New Yorkers feel towards general maintance and 
    appearance of the subway stations. On a couple of occasions when walking down to the J train portion of the Sutphin Blvd-Archer AV-JFK Airport station, you can see clear as day, a giant rat on the station platform at one end of the station before it then runs away into the subway tunnel at the approach of people filling up the platform. So I just
    felt that darken the image felt like the right move in terms display this point across.</p>
