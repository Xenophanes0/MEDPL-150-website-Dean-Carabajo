    <p>I find this exhibit to be more unsettling than traditional art pieces/ exhibits in museums, as there is usually a message or reason to their creations, whether a form of artistic expression from the artist themselves deriving from a traumatic experience in their life, critique on human aspects, or a social issue. Meanwhile this art piece is just 
    surreal experience in trying to make sense of it, more or less being true to it's title of a "Brainrotting Wastleland". Almost everything within the movable city is distortion of objects in reality, such as the few structures that resemble humanoid beings of differing colors, or the pink-reddish house-like structure that resembles a house, with 
    smaller details mixed in with teeth or veins. Doesn't help that there are weird choices for the city's scoring, ranging from a simple note playing on repeat to just bodily-like noises or growling from approaching some areas of the digital city, as well as the liminal space of the exhibit, with the sky being a grey-ish color and fog covering up farther 
    away structures when navigating through the digital city. Creating an uncanny feeling as you don't know how far the city stretches and the only surrounding things are twisted versions of things you see on a daily basis. Another element adding to the distortion of reality feeling is the few page-like walls that floating within the city, one of them 
    showing what I presume is a parody of the Catholic faith, with a drawing of a church with an eye over its front door and labeled "Cis Hetero Catholic Church", with "my sin" written around the church as a wiggly entity is overlooking the building. Don't necessarily know if this is trying to make a statement of Christianity being against same sex relationships 
    or another critique of recent times that wants to vilify the stereotypical white heterosexual male of the United States for how the country treated other ethnic groups in the past with the labeling of "Cis Hetero Catholic Church". Either way, this exhibit really lives up to its title concerning to the decrease of mental cognition amongst the present generation, 
    especially the youth of today, with most of their time being on their phones consuming short form, low value digital content from social media, primarily Tiktok and Youtube. I point to these platforms specifically because of the rapid growth and success of Tiktok led to the other platform sites implementing their own form of short form content hubs to 
    ride the success that Tiktok had and Youtube massively pushing for Youtube Shorts for their own profit and holding the greatest daily audience that uses their services for content consumption. Now with the rapid increase of luxuries at a younger age, like having a smart phone, the younger children can more easier just be glued to the phones in their hands 
    without learning of self-restraint or any form of digital safety when it comes to what content to consume online, with an increasing number just being content-farm channels or a.i. channels. This being exemplified through the "Skibidi Toilet" back in 2023, where a series of heads within toilets taking to take over the world had been the most popular thing 
    on Youtube at the time, getting so popular to get 26 seasons on Youtube. Probably the exhibit being a look into one's mentality that has been over taken by brainrot, with how everything is just a weird deformation of logical things in the world. Also the lack of meaning to this exhibit really adds to the uncanny feeling when traveling inside, as I tried to 
    see if there was a reason for the exhibit's creation online, with no results, with the exhibit's description just advertising the release of the exhibit. A sharp contrast to "Ruins of Tomorrow" by Sophia zichen Lyu, with it created specificity to showcase the environment in ruins in the wake of differing natural disasters, with the description of the exhibit 
    and text within the digital city reminding the quest of this, while this exhibit is left up to the choice of the quest of how they would interpret it.</p>
