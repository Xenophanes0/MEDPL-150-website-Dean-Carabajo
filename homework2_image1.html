    <h1>Homework 2 Image 1</h1>
    <p>Here is the first image for Homework 2:</p>

    <p>I took this photograph with the goal of expressing movement in the image as well. I positioned myself at a crosswalk with the camera pointed towards the road, then snapped at photograph when cars were moving parallel to the people going on the crosswalk with a low shutter speed on the dslr camera to add in a blur effect to the image for my desired movement effect.
