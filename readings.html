    <h1>Reading #2 - "With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster"</h1>
    <p>I do share a similar position with Nesrine Malik, that ai content is being produced on a massive scale without any form of regulation from the social media platforms they are posted, such as Youtube, Whatsapp and X to name a few. This is because when 
      generative ai was introduced in 2022 with ai models like ChatGPT, Gemini or Sora, anyone could make whatever they wanted with ai doing the heavy work for them. Lucky with initial ai models, they couldn't make an image or drawing that looked genuinely man-made, 
      there were always mistakes about them that an immediate/ professional graphic artist would never make. These mistakes included misshapen limbs when ai was trying to make realistic drawings, inconsistent lighting and other issues, and that allowed for the general 
      audience to quickly distinguish what drawings were made by actual artists and what was ai generated. This normally isn't an issue as it is easy to spot which is which, except for those that are more gullible than most, or if the art just somehow slipped through 
      the cracks, with two incidents that reflect both issues I brought up. First, roughly over nine months ago a French woman, named Anne, was convinced to divorce her husband and use the $850 thousand she got through said divorce to help Brad Pitt fund a surgery that 
      would save his life. To the shock of no one but her, it was scammer decided to use the persona of a famous Hollywood actor as a means of a quick payday from a clueless women. The ai part of this story is that the scammer used ai to create images of Brad Pitt in 
      the hospital to convince Anne in handing over whatever money she had, as well as convincing her to divorce her husband. The kicker is that anyone with an average IQ can tell the images were fake, with a grainy filter over them, some proportions of Brad Pitt's face 
      not properly scaled to the rest of his head, or holding a sign with "I love you Anne" written on it. Secondly, I would like to bring up the 2024 Pokemon Illustration contest held up the Pokemon TCG. For those that don't know, for this yearly contest, the Pokemon TGC 
      releases a list of pokemon that you can draw and if you do draw then, then you have a chance to have your artwork printed on a Pokemon trading card. For the 2024 contest, They announced and showed the artworks of the 300 quarter-finalists of the contest, only for 
      people to do some digging and find out that several of the artworks were made by ai. So several spots that could have been filled by a fan that wants to show their love of the franchise, or artists wishing for their artwork to be more publicly known had their spots 
      taken by someone who put in no effort and just copy and pasted something they didn't even make themselves. These issues aren't going to be one offs, as programmers are making these generative ai models smarter and smarter with newer versions of ai coming out. Ai 
      content is becoming more and more realist where it is harder to distinguish what is ai and what isn't, especially as the watermark for the Sora ai is being found to be easily removed from ai videos through the use of third-party tools. I don't have a problem with 
      ai content itself, I do listen to some music or songs made with ai, my problem is when these "creators" of these type of media not crediting usage of ai when it is made public or any form of social media platforms doing the bare minimum in regulating these types of 
      content and letting these ai content farms run amok on their platforms.</p>

    <h1>Reading #3 - "Graphic Novel: Motherhood in crisis - Memunatu: The distant patient ‘Birth in my village’"</h1>
    <p>Illustrations were used in Memunatu's story to give a visual to the audience when she was describing each portion of her story in relation to her initial childbirth. This is because towards the end of her story, there are a few pages of the graphic novel where it 
    shows Memunatu at the centre, after delivering her second child. What's noticeable is that Memunatu appears to be be an adult, whereas in the novel, she was always drawn more of an adolescent, so a clear passage of time occurred between when Memunatu first visited the 
    centre and the second time (where photographs were used). Highly likely that to give her tragic experience considering her first childbirth and the aftermath of it going wrong, illustrations were used to give her experience more weight and show how miserable she was in 
    being judged by her surrounding village over her still-birth and the constant pain she was in with her injured fistula. This was through the graphic novel always displaying Memunatu's inner thoughts and fears and always focusing on Memunatu, even when others were around, 
    several pages only show Memunatu or at least drawn from her own perspective, rather than from some third person viewing the scene. We're essentially meant to be one with Memunatu's experience during the shown events, and having some illustrations drawn from her view assists 
    in that. Additionally showing how anxious she was initially being at the centre to help fix the pain she was in, afterall from her perspective the last person she trusted lied about being her village's traditional birth attendants and caused the pain she was suffering from 
    for several months. Additionally, it is easier to depict raw emotions on people easier through illustrations, as the artist can put in more details to a person in a drawing in order to reflect what the person is feeling. Finally, the illustrations help to create the surrounding 
    environments of Memunatu's village life and how the centre looked like, as shown in the end, a clear passage of time occurred and it is impossible to say if the surrounding events changed as well. Additionally, there is the likely chance that no photos exist of her first 
    visit to the centre or of her daily village life, with how it is shown being more belonging of a third world country, so the illustrations provided a better visual image to the audience than just blocks of text in a realistic sense to Memunatu's anecdote. Illustrations vary 
    from photographs being fundamentally a loose reflection of real life, while photographs are meant to be a purely reflection of the real world. This is because photographs were designed to create a still-life image of whatever environment it took a picture of, while illustrations 
    are meant to try and recreate that reality from the world up, if someone chooses to. Additionally, illustrations solely rely off the individuals drawing skills to create a real-life thing, like a portrait for example, while it is relatively easier to take a photograph of an 
    object. The only real difference in photographic skill level would be the clearness and visual details of the object that the photograph was taken of. Meanwhile with illustrations, like that typically found in a graphic novel, are more of a cartoony look or feel to them. Being 
    more of a reimagining of the locations and people drawn than being a complete one to one still-life drawing. Of course there are talented artist that can draw very closely to real life and photographers that focus very much on one image to get every detail they want in their 
    photograph, but on average, it is much easier to get a clean, realistic photograph of its location and any passerbys than drawing whole location and people walking through, down to the finest details.</p>
