    <h1>Reading #2 - "With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster"</h1>
    <p>I do share a similar position with Nesrine Malik, that ai content is being produced on a massive scale without any form of regulation from the social media platforms they are posted, such as Youtube, Whatsapp and X to name a few. This is because when generative ai was introduced in 2022 with ai models like ChatGPT, Gemini or Sora, anyone 
      could make whatever they wanted with ai doing the heavy work for them. Lucky with initial ai models, they couldn't make an image or drawing that looked genuinely man-made, there were always mistakes about them that an immediate/ professional graphic artist would never make. These mistakes included misshapen limbs when ai was trying to make
      realistic drawings, inconsistent lighting and other issues, and that allowed for the general audience to quickly distinguish what drawings were made by actual artists and what was ai generated. This normally isn't an issue as it is easy to spot which is which, except for those that are more gullible than most, or if the art just somehow 
      slipped through the cracks, with two incidents that reflect both issues I brought up. First, roughly over nine months ago a French woman, named Anne, was convinced to divorce her husband and use the $850 thousand she got through said divorce to help Brad Pitt fund a surgery that would save his life. To the shock of no one but her, it was scammer 
      decided to use the persona of a famous Hollywood actor as a means of a quick payday from a clueless women. The ai part of this story is that the scammer used ai to create images of Brad Pitt in the hospital to convince Anne in handing over whatever money she had, as well as convincing her to divorce her husband. The kicker is that anyone with an average IQ can tell the images 
      were fake, with a grainy filter over them, some proportions of Brad Pitt's face not properly scaled to the rest of his head, or holding a sign with "I love you Anne" written on it. Secondly, I would like to bring up the 2024 Pokemon Illustration contest held up the Pokemon TCG. For those that don't know, for this yearly contest, the 
      Pokemon TGC releases a list of pokemon that you can draw and if you do draw then, then you have a chance to have your artwork printed on a Pokemon trading card. For the 2024 contest, They announced and showed the artworks of the 300 quarter-finalists of the contest, only for people to do some digging and find out that several of the artworks 
      were made by ai. So several spots that could have been filled by a fan that wants to show their love of the franchise, or artists wishing for their artwork to be more publicly known had their spots taken by someone who put in no effort and just copy and pasted something they didn't even make themselves. These issues aren't going to be one offs, 
      as programmers are making these generative ai models smarter and smarter with newer versions of ai coming out. Ai content is becoming more and more realist where it is harder to distinguish what is ai and what isn't, especially as the watermark for the Sora ai is being found to be easily removed from ai videos through the use of third-party tools.
      I don't have a problem with ai content itself, I do listen to some music or songs made with ai, my problem is when these "creators" of these type of media not crediting usage of ai when it is made public or any form of social media platforms doing the bare minimum in regulating these types of content and letting these ai content farms run amok on 
      their platforms.</p>
