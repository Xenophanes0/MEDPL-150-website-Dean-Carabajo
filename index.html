  <p>Dean Carabajo<br>Artist living in New York. I wish to create 2D and 3D animations surrounding the topics I enjoy, which mainly are certain video game series/ characters, or anime series. The reason I even want to create animations in the first place started off with witnessing how fluid and high paced action scenes from anime can be, specifically pointing towards the battle between Gogeta and Broly during the Dragon Ball Super: Broly (2018) film and the different bey battles in Beyblade Metal Fight: VS the Sun: Sol Blaze, the scorching Hot Invader (2010).
      The tools I have some experience in are Adobe Photoshop, Krita, Inkscape, Wix.</p>
