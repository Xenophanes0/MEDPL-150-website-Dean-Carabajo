    <p>I wanted to create something in illustrator that further reinfroced the pollution theme of the original photomontage that it is being attached to, so I decided to base my illsutrator document off of the premise of the film "The Host" (2006), by Bong Joon-ho, and it's surrounding backstory to the film.
    The film is about a sea creature emerging from the Han River and kipnapping a man's daughter, with the man and his extended family's attempts to rescue the daughter. AN important plot plot to the film being how unsympathetic government officials are in the film, as the creation of the monster in the film 
    was due to an American military pathologist demanding for an Korean assistant to violate protocols and simpliy dump over 200 bottles worthy of formaldehyde down a drain, which led into the Han River. If exposed to the chemical long term, it is capable of producing cancer into animals, inlcuding people, while 
    in the film it caused a giant monster that feeds off of people. However the director of the film did note that he based the film off of an incident that occurred in Feburary 2000, </p>
