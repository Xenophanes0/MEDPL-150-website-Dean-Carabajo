    <h1>Homework #5 : Social Campaign - Photomontage & Design</h1>
    <h2>Create an illustrator document and incorporate it into one of the previous social campaign photomontages.</h2>

    <h3>Photomontage Image with an illustrator document creation attached</h3>

    <p>I wanted to create something in illustrator that further reinforced the pollution theme of the original photomontage that it is being attached to, so I decided to base my illustrator document off of the premise of the film "The Host" (2006), by Bong Joon-ho, and it's surrounding backstory to the film.
    The film is about a sea creature emerging from the Han River and kidnapping a man's daughter, with the man and his extended family's attempts to rescue the daughter. An important plot plot to the film being how unsympathetic government officials are in the film, as the creation of the monster in the film 
    was due to an American military pathologist demanding for an Korean assistant to violate protocols and simply dump over 200 bottles worthy of formaldehyde down a drain, which led into the Han River. If exposed to the chemical long term, it is capable of producing cancer into animals, including people, while 
    in the film it caused a giant monster that feeds off of people. However the director of the film did note that he based the film off of an article coming out in regards of a deformed fish with an S-shaped spine caught in the Han River. This article likely refers to an incident that occurred in February 2000, 
    where an American mortician, working for the U.S> military, had forced a subordinate to dump over 480 bottles of formaldehyde down a drain, which led to the Han River, which the U.S. military later had to apologize for. Considering the timeline of events, they are most likely correlated to one another. Anyways, 
    with my previous reasons for creating my photomontage centering around pollution, and The Host's commentary of pollution harming the environment with the real-life incident involving the American military, I wanted to base my illustration in a similar vein as how the monster from The Host came about. So I drew in 
    a monster whose entire being centered around vast amounts of garbage, being the first boss of Yo Kai Watch 3: Junkernaut. He is especially a spirit that resides in a scrapyard and uses the surrounding scrap as armor through assimilation. He is even encountered through the main cast of the game investigating rumors of 
    a "monster in the scrap yard" and battles him when he makes himself known. Figured with how I framed my photograph with what each image represents and the image as a whole, Junkernaut would have made for a fine addition to the photomontage, with the people still choosing to ignore the issue of pollution, even when issues 
    in nature start to arise, like the one deformed fish. Just have Junkernaut be the replacement in this case.

       I was able to create my illustration through the use of the shapes tool to construct the body, eye and various parts of the armor Junkernaut is wearing. I used the drawing and pen tools to create portions of Junkernaut that are more fluid, to not make it look rigid if I used shapes, like the arms, fan blades on his 
    left hand and the claw portions of his right hand. I did my best with trying to recreate Junkernaut with illustrator tools and still have him be recognizable enough to where someone who played Yo Kai Watch 3 could see the resemblance, even without every small detail being there.</p>
